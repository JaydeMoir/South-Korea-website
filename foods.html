    was stored in large earthenware fermentation vessels, 
    called onggi, 
    in the ground to prevent freezing during the winter months and to keep it cool enough to slow down,
    the fermentation process during summer months.
    The process of making kimchi was called gimjang and was a way for the whole village to participate.

<p>Sundubu jjigae: (Korean: 순두부찌개) is a jjigae in Korean cuisine. 
    The dish is made with freshly curdled extra soft tofu (sundubu) 
    which has not been strained and pressed, vegetables, sometimes mushrooms,

    but can also be ground out of solid stone. 
    A raw egg can be put in the jjigae just before serving, 
    and the dish is delivered while bubbling vigorously. 
    It is typically eaten with a bowl of cooked white rice and several banchan.
    Extra soft tofu, called sundubu (순두부; lit. mild tofu) in Korean,

    The first iteration of sundubu was discovered by a Joseon civil official, 
    who used spring water and sea water during its cooking process. 
    The stew has multiple variations from various counties in South Korea.
    The dish has reached popularity overseas, 
    making appearances in American and Canadian media such as,
    Kim's Convenience of CBC Television. 
    Restaurants that specialise in sundubu-jjigae can be found in many cities, 
    usually Koreatowns, in the United States and Canada. </p>

<p>Bulgogi: (Korean: 불고기, 'fire meat') is a gui 
    (Korean-style grilled or roasted dish) made of thin, 
    marinated slices of meat, most commonly beef, 
    grilled on a barbecue or on a stove-top griddle.

    Once a royal dish, japchae is now one of the most popular traditional celebration dishes,
    often served on special occasions, such as weddings, birthdays 
    (especially dol, the first birthday, and hwangap, the sixtieth), and holidays. 
    It is also popular at banquets, parties, and potlucks, 
    due to the ease of bulk preparation and flexible serving: 
    japchae can be served warm, at room temperature, or cold from the refrigerator,

<p>Korean fried chicken: (Korean: 치킨, from the English word "chicken"),

    These include the basic huraideu-chicken 
    (후라이드 치킨, from the English words 'fried chicken') 
    and the spicy yangnyeom chicken (양념 치킨, 'seasoned chicken').
    In South Korea, fried chicken is consumed as a meal, 
    an appetizer, anju (food that is served and eaten with drinks), 
    or as an after-meal snack.
    Korean fried chicken was described by Julia Moskin of The New York Times, 
    as having a "thin, crackly and almost transparent crust".
    The chicken is usually seasoned with spices, sugar, and salt, 
    before and after being fried. 
    Korean fried chicken restaurants commonly use small or medium-sized chickens; 
    these younger chickens result in more tender meat. After frying, 
    the chicken is usually hand-painted with sauce, 
    using a brush to evenly coat the chicken with a thin layer. 
    Pickled radishes and beer (or carbonated drink) 
    are often served with Korean fried chicken. </p>

<p>Gimbap: Gimbap (Korean: 김밥; lit. seaweed rice; IPA: [kim.p͈ap̚]), 
    also romanized as kimbap, is a Korean dish made from bap (cooked rice), 
    vegetables, and optionally cooked seafood or meat, 
    rolled in gim—dried sheets of seaweed—and served in bite-sized slices. 
    Some sources say it originates from Japanese norimaki, 
    introduced during Japanese colonial rule,
    while others argue it is a modernized version of bokssam from the Joseon era. 
    The dish is often part of a packed meal, or dosirak, 
    to be eaten at picnics and outdoor events, 
    and can serve as a light lunch along with danmuji (yellow pickled radish) and kimchi. 
    It is a popular takeaway food in South Korea and abroad. </p>

<p> Bungeoppang: (Korean: 붕어빵; lit. carp bread) 
    is a fish-shaped pastry stuffed with sweetened red bean paste, 
    which originated from the Japanese taiyaki. 
    One of South Korea's most popular winter street foods,
    the snack is often sold at street stalls, 
    grilled on an appliance similar to a waffle iron but with a fish-shaped mold. 
    Red bean paste is the standard filling, 
    but many bungeo-ppang sold as street food are filled with pastry cream 
    (called "choux-bung" as the cream is called "choux-cream" in South Korea), 
    sweet potato, pizza toppings, chocolate, kimchi and others. 
    Usually, it costs about 1,000 won (KRW) for three bungeo-ppang. 
    However, small bungeo-ppang, 
    costs 1,000 won for five and large bungeo-ppang, 
    costs 2,000 won for one, 
    indicating that the price range varies depending on the size. </p>

<p>Pajeon: (Korean: 파전; pronounced [pʰa.dʑʌn]) 
    is a variety of jeon with scallion as its prominent ingredient, 
    as pa (파) means scallion. It is a Korean dish made from a batter of eggs, 
    wheat flour, rice flour, scallions, 
    and often other ingredients depending on the variety. 
    Beef, pork, kimchi, shellfish, and other seafood are mostly used.
    If one of these ingredients, such as squid, dominates the jeon, 
    the name will reflect that; e.g. ojingeo jeon (오징어전) is 'squid jeon'.
    Pajeon is usually recognizable by the highly visible scallions. 
    It is similar to a Chinese scallion pancake in appearance; however, 
    unlike the Chinese dish (but like Western pancakes), 
    it is made from a liquid batter and thus has a lighter texture. </p>

<p> Bingsu (Korean: 빙수; lit. frozen water), sometimes written as bingsoo,
    is a milk-based, 
    Korean shaved ice dessert with sweet toppings that may include chopped fruit, 
    condensed milk, fruit syrup, and red beans.
    The most common variety is pat-bingsu (Korean: 팥빙수, lit,'red bean frozen water'), 
    topped with sweet red beans. 
    The main ingredient of bingsu was natural ice in the past, 
    but later, artificial ice was produced, and high-quality sweeteners were developed. 
    Many modern bingsu varieties use frozen milk rather than water-based ice. 
    Historically, the ice-cutting machine was a simple tool in the shape of a plane, 
    but now, most shaved ice is created by electric ice shavers. </p>

    <p>Samgyetang: (Korean: 삼계탕), or "ginseng chicken soup" is a tang (Korean soup) 
        that consists primarily of a whole young chicken (poussin) 
        or quail filled with garlic, rice, jujube and ginseng.
        It is traditionally considered to be a health food.
        Samgye-tang is a representative summer health food. 
        Soup made with chicken that is slightly larger than,
        the chick is called yeonggye baeksuk, 
        and the chicken is divided into half is called banggye-tang. </p><section class="line_below" ></section>

    <h2>South Korea Popular Foods: </h2> 

<p>Soju: (English pronunciation: /soʊdʒu/; Korean: 소주; Hanja: 燒酒) 
    is a clear and colorless distilled alcoholic beverage from Korea,
    traditionally made from rice, 
    but later from other grains and has a flavor similar to vodka.
    It is usually consumed neat. 
    Its alcohol content varies from about 12.5% to 53% alcohol by volume (ABV). 
    Since 2007 low alcohol soju (below 20%) has become the most common type.
    Traditionally, most brands of soju are produced in the Andong region, 
    but also in other regions and countries. 
    While soju was traditionally made from rice, 
    South Korean ethanol producers replace rice with other starch, 
    such as cassava due to significantly lower capital costs. 
    Soju often appears similar to several other East Asian liquors, 
    while differing in alcohol contents. </p>

<p>Makgeolli:  (Korean: 막걸리; pronounced [mak.k͈ʌɭɭi]; lit. raw rice wine), 
    sometimes anglicized to makkoli (mækəli/, MAK-ə-lee), 
    is a Korean alcoholic drink. 
    It is a milky, off-white, 
    and lightly sparkling rice wine that has a slight viscosity, 
    and tastes slightly sweet, tangy, bitter, and astringent. 
    Chalky sediment gives it a cloudy appearance.
    As a low proof drink of six to nine percent alcohol by volume, 
    it is often considered a "communal beverage" rather than hard liquor.
    In Korea, makgeolli is often unpasteurized, 
    and the wine continues to mature in the bottle. 
    Because of the short shelf life of unpasteurized "draft" makgeolli, 
    many exported makgeolli undergo pasteurization, 
    which deprives the beverage of complex enzymes and flavor compounds.
    Recently, various fruits such as strawberries, 
    bananas have been added to makgeolli to create forms with new flavours. </p>

<p>Milkis: Milkis (Korean: 밀키스; RR: Milkiseu)
    is a South Korean soft drink produced by Lotte Chilsung, 
    a South Korean beverage company.
    It combines many of the common elements of traditional carbonated beverages, 
    such as sugar and carbonated water with milk to create a creamy taste; 
    its label proclaims "New feeling of soda beverage". 
    As of 2024, U.S.-market Milkis cans state "Korea's No.1 Cream Soda".
    Milkis is available in orange, strawberry, mango, melon, 
    banana, peach, apple, and classic (regular) flavors; 
    the classic flavor is also featured as a glaze in pastries.
    It is a popular beverage in South Korea, and it is available worldwide. </p>

<p>Banana flavored milk: (Korean: 바나나맛 우유) 
    is a South Korean milk beverage produced by Binggrae.
    The beverage consists of approximately 80 percent milk, 
    and a comparably small amount of banana flavor.
    Other regular flavors sold by Binggrae include strawberry, 
    melon, banana light, coffee, and sugarless zero. 
    Additionally, lychee, peach, mandarin, mulberry, 
    and pumpkin-sweet potato were, or are currently, seasonal flavors. </p>

<p>Rice wine: Rice wine is an alcoholic beverage fermented from rice, 
    traditionally consumed in East Asia, 
    Southeast Asia and South Asia, where rice is a quintessential staple crop. 
    Rice wine is made by the fermentation of rice starch, 
    during which, 
    microbes enzymatically convert polysaccharides to sugar and then to ethanol.
    The Chinese mijiu (most famous being huangjiu), Japanese sake, and Korean cheongju, 
    dansul and takju are some of the most notable types of rice wine.
    Rice wine typically has an alcohol content of 10 to 25% ABV, 
    and is typically served warm. 
    One panel of taste testers arrived at 60 °C (140 °F) 
    as an optimum serving temperature.
    Rice wines are drunk as a dining beverage in East Asian, 
    Southeast Asian and South Asian cuisine during formal dinners and banquets, 
    also be used as cooking wines to add flavors, 
    or to neutralize unwanted tastes in certain food items 
    (e.g. seafood such as fish and shellfish). </p>


<p>Maesil-ju:Maesil-ju (Korean: 매실주), also called plum wine, plum liquor, 
    or plum liqueur, is an alcoholic drink infused with maesil (plums). 
    The exact origins of Maesil-ju are unknown, 
    but it is thought to date back to the 918-1392 Goryeo period. </p>

<p>Baekseju: Baekseju (Korean: 백세주; sold under the brand name Bek Se Ju) 
    is a Korean glutinous rice-based, 
    fermented alcoholic beverage flavored with a variety of herbs, 
    ginseng most prominent among them. 
    The name comes from the legend, 
    that the healthful herbs in baekseju, 
    will allow an individual to live up to 100 years old.
    The drink is infused with ginseng and eleven other herbs, 
    including licorice, omija (Schisandra chinensis), 
    gugija (Chinese wolfberry), 
    Astragalus propinquus root, ginger, and cinnamon. </p>

<p> Bokbunja-ju (Korean: 복분자주; Hanja: 覆盆子酒), 
    also called bokbunja wine, 
    is a Korean fruit wine made from wild and/or cultivated black raspberry — traditionally, 
    of the Korean species Bokbunja (Rubus coreanus).
    The beverage is produced in Gochang County, North Jeolla Province, 
    in Damyang, South Jeolla Province, and in Jeju Province, South Korea.
    It is made by fermenting berries with water.
    Some varieties also contain rice and reishi mushroom extract.
    Bohae Bokbunjajoo of Bohae Brewery Co., Ltd. 
    is the most well-known bokbunja liquor. </p>


<p>Ginseng tea: (Korean: 인삼차; Hanja: 人蔘茶; 
    insam means ginseng and cha means tea in Korean), 
    is a traditional Korean tea made with ginseng.
    While it is called a tea, ginseng tea does not contain tea leaves. 
    It is a herbal tea infusion made out of the ginseng plant's root.
    Ginseng is a perennial herb derived from the aromatic root of Panax Ginseng Meyer, 
    also known as Korean ginseng. Ginseng grows in shady forests that are cool and damp.
    It is a slow-growing plant and is difficult to cultivate.
    It can take four to six years before the root is ready to be harvested.
    Ginseng roots have a forked and twisted appearance that somewhat resembles the human body.
    Ginseng roots have been used in East Asian countries for more than 2,000 years.
    The roots can be used fresh; however, 
    there are various forms which can be processed in different ways for different uses.
    Fresh roots can be processed into red ginseng (홍삼, hongsam) 
    by steaming and drying, or into white ginseng (백삼, paeksam) 
    by a simpler process of air-drying. </p>

<p>Sujeonggwa: (Korean: 수정과) is a Korean traditional cinnamon punch. 
    Dark reddish brown in color, it is made from mainly cinnamon, 
    sugar, water and ginger. 
    It is often served with gotgam (dried persimmon) and garnished with pine nuts.
    The punch is made by brewing first the cinnamon sticks and ginger at a slow boil. 
    The solids are then removed for clarification, 
    the remaining liquid is boiled again after adding either honey or brown sugar. 
    The dried persimmons are cut into portions, 
    and are added to soak and soften after the brew has completely cooled. 
    This is usually done several hours before serving, 
    as extensive soaking of the fruit may thicken the clear liquid to a murky appearance.
    Sujeonggwa is served cold and commonly as a dessert, much like sikhye, 
    due to its sweet taste. It is also widely available in canned form. </p>

<p>Dalgona coffee:also known as hand beaten coffee, 
    is a beverage originating from Macau made by whipping equal parts instant coffee powder, 
    sugar, and hot water until it becomes creamy and then adding it to cold or hot milk.
    Occasionally, it is topped with coffee powder, cocoa, crumbled biscuits, or honey.
    It was popularized on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
    when people refraining from going out started making videos of whipping the coffee at home, 
    by hand without using electrical mixers.
    After the drink spread to South Korea, it was renamed "dalgona coffee" which is derived from dalgona, 
    a Korean sugar candy, due to the resemblance in taste and appearance, 
    though most dalgona coffee does not actually contain dalgona. </p>

<p>Gwaha-ju:(Korean: 과하주; Hanja: 過夏酒; lit. summer-passing wine) 
    is a traditional Korean fortified rice wine. 
    The refined rice wine cheongju (also called yakju)

    Popular varieties include gangha-ju (강하주) 
    of Boseong and Yeonggwang in South Jeolla Province, 
    sinseon-ju (신선주) of Namwon in North Jeolla Province, 
    and yak-soju (약소주) of Suwon in Gyeonggi Province. </p>
